      <h1>This is the Moon!</h1>
      <p>
        Did you know that the moon was first discovered in July 1609? The moon
        is Earth's only natural satellite, with a diameter of approximately
        3,474 kilometers (2,159 miles), making it the fifth largest satellite in
        the solar system. It orbits Earth approximately once every 27.3 days.

      <h1>This is a Galaxy!</h1>
      <p>
        Did you know that the Milky Way Galaxy was discovered a year after
        discovering the moon? The Milky Way contains hundreds of billions of
        stars, along with vast amounts of interstellar gas and dust. In modern
        times, scientific exploration of the Milky Way and its constituent stars
        provides insight into the universe's history, evolution, and future.

      <h1>This is a Black Hole!</h1>
      <p>
        Did you know that the first Black Hole was discovered in 1971? A black
        hole is a region of space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not
        even light, can escape from it once it crosses a boundary called the
        event horizon. At the center of a black hole lies a point of infinite
        density called the singularity, where the laws of physics as we know
        them break down.
